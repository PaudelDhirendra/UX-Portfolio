                <h1>Remind ME</h1>
                <p>
                    Remind Me was originally a Mobile Application work tool concept, an editable task schedular for
                    busy
                    professionals. <br>I was approached by a company - because their application is
                    in development, their product and their name will remain anonymous for this case study at their
                    request.
                    <br>Tasked with designing a data driven advertising website for them, I was asked, "whether or
                    not
                    their application could be so much more than just another work tool?"
                    <br> Using a wide array of User interaction, testing and application on their prototype,
                    answered -
                    yes it could and should be so much more!
                    <br>This case study discovered that the target audience could be enhanced, further development
                    opportunities arose that would help the Application succeed with the potential to become a worthy
                    competitor for this market
                    and a data driven designed website too to enhance their marketing campaign on release.

            <div class="start">
                <h2>Product Vision</h2>
                <p> The company's vision was to ascertain whether there was any demand from the general public to
                    enhance their target audience, focusing on:
                <ul>
                    <li>How their product stacked up against the three main competitors currently on the market, who
                        also had a To-Do
                        type application released already.</li>
                    <li>To answer this I had to discover any possible development opportunities to make the application
                        appeal to the general
                        public, rather tha the original plan as solely a professional task manager tool.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, collect the data from this research and design a website around this data.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="middle">
                <h2>Discovered User Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    It appeared that some aspects of their original plan were biased, in the sense that they did not
                    include, or report, any user input
                    throughout and so it was fair to infer that at this stage, was still in its infancy.
                    <br>
                    I highlighted my intentions to obtain some User input through public surveys and interviews
                    ensuring
                    total anonymity for
                    the company, the product and the user was ethically upheld.
                    This was to identify if there was any demand for their product from the general public, capture
                    the
                    user needs and
                    emotions then design around the user and the business in a data driven method.

                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <p>
                    Tasked with designing the website to advertise the product depending on whether there was any
                    demand
                    for
                    their product from the general public or more business orientated. <br>
                    This was answered using public surveys and interviews, comparing the prototype against three
                    similar
                    market leading
                    products available on the market.
                    I was also able to create a data-driven SWOT analysis and user Personas from this data.
                    Using the data I was carried out the Ideation Prioritisation on what was
                    most important to show the Users that visited the website.
                    Rapid Prototyping, Wireframes and Hi-Def designs were drafted and user tested for the website so
                    that they were in the
                    best possible position for the developers, the user and for the business.

        <h1>Discovery and Ideation</h1>
        <p>
            I began by researching the existing market on tailored Applications for task scheduling. After multiple
            forum reviews and questionnaires, 72 responses were gathered and 15 moderated interviews
            that were captured primarily via Social Media Networks and an online Survey.
            The data allowed me to paint a clearer picture of what the User's wanted from the product, what they
            expected and more importantly an accurate representation on who wanted the application.
            This information provided me with enough information to build a SWOT Analysis and User personas for
            further
            research.
        </p>
        <p>
            What followed were efforts to map the existing user experiences to identify other opportunity
            developments:

            <h2>Discovery Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Whilst interviewing the user's I ascertained that most of the applications available on the market were
                too
                complicated for the everyday user. This answered why the company had such a narrow
                target audience and aimed purely at professionals as a work tool. A suggestion that was accepted by the
                company was to make the HCI simpler and less 'cumbersome or business-like,' this would make
                it more appealable to the everyday user - thus expanding the target audience. I wasn't part of the
                design
                team for Application design, so defining it would have meant leveraging away from the scope of
                this case study, nevertheless, the SWOT Analysis findings highlighted areas for further product
                development
                opportunities, so that the application could appeal to the every day user too.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the survey, I asked whether any of the participants had a similar application, which brand did
                they
                prefer and also which they did not like and why? Interviews were arranged
                through the survey, pain points were identified with our prototype and what the user would expect from
                the
                proposed website, this was so that I could paint a picture on a natural User flow for the site.

                    Based on discovery research findings I came up with three hypothesis to ensure successful
                    product
                    adoption. These covered: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Essential Security for the checkout areas.</li>
                    <li>Visual hierarchy for the product.</li>
                    <li>Simple and easily identifiable price section for the different versions of the product to
                        enhance transparency and the trust from the user.</li>
                    <li>A visually pleasing and interactive review section.</li>
                    <li>A user friendly, safe and secure checkout section.</li>
                    <li> A user friendly contact section.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The features were listed and mapped based in technical complexity, potential Business and User
                    efficiency values. The highest
                    impact features were expected to be included in the developed product.

        <h1>Outcomes</h1>
        <p>
            Based on the findings from both the UX research and the Design validation sessions I was able to produce
            a list of changes that were addressed and updated in the prototype along with any potential future
            alterations for the Application passed onto the company.<br>
            It was realised during the Validation stage that all of the user's became concerned when they clicked on
            the video section of the design and wondered why the video didn't play. It was mentioned prior to
            testing that there was no promotional video provided as the
            company wanted their application to appeal to the general public and at that moment in time was
            developed as businesses tool.
            They did
            not want to confuse the participants by advertising something that it wasn't going to be, so a decision
            on their part was to not include the video. Another thing was because of the potential improvements
            found was
            significantly different to the application that they had, some of the details in the designs such as
            descriptive text will
            change once those improvements are developed.
            Below you will find links to the Mobile, Desktop and the Design Specifications for the website. Please
            enjoy and thank you.
